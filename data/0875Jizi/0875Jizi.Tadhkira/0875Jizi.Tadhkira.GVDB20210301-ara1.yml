90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a short text I typed up from a unique manuscript held
    in the Dar al-Kutub in Egypt (MS Dār al-Kutub Majāmīʿ 391). Nothing is known
    about its author except the name he provides in this text. The text is dated to
    the year 866 and dedicated to the Mamluk sultan Khushqadam, so I have accorded
    the date 875 to the text, until possible further evidence emerges. Version links
    are from the manuscript description I made for the MMSII Bibliography of Arabic
    Historiography.
      NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): The second header was a part of the body text. I untagged it but kept its tag blank. A title should be added here in square brackets; Likewise for the first tag which is the introduction.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
