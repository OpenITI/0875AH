90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The titles are a line below the tag. The majority of
        semantic units are book entries, which are currently tagged as ## $.
        There is one section that includes actual biographical entries (Chapter
        5). Correspondence is good with no obvious errors.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): One title added in square brackets in page 129.
        PARATEXT added. 2- A part of page 104 is missing. 3- I don’t see the
        biographical entries mentioned by the annotator (the text is a bibliographical
        dictionary).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
