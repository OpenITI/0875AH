90#VERS#COMMENT##: Publisher is wrongly detailed as Dar al-Basha'ir al-
    Islamiyya in the metadata. The actual publisher is Maktab al-Matbu'at
    al-Islamiyya. The text is extremely long, amounting to over 10 volumes.
    As such, textual correspondence has only been checked on a number of
    select pages throughout the work. The numbering of biographical entries
    appears consistent w/ the printed edition. Pagination failed; there are
    also some other embedded pages numbers in square brackets (generally odd
    only), but these are also not consistent w/ the printed edition, and
    should probably be removed.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A few untagged headers tagged. The levelling of a
    few headers changed. Women’s biographies tagged. 2- About
    the numbering system of the entries, see the editor’s introduction (vol 1, page
    148).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
