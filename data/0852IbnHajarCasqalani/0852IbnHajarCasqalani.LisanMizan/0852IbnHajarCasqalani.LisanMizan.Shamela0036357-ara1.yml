90#VERS#COMMENT##: Publisher is wrongly detailed as Dar al-Basha'ir al-Islamiyya in the metadata. The actual publisher is Maktab al-Matbu'at al-Islamiyya. The text is extremely long, amounting to over 10 volumes. As such, textual correspondence has only been checked on a number of select pages throughout the work. The numbering of biographical entries appears consistent w/ the printed edition. Pagination failed; there are also some other embedded pages numbers in square brackets (generally odd only), but these are also not consistent w/ the printed edition, and should probably be removed.
