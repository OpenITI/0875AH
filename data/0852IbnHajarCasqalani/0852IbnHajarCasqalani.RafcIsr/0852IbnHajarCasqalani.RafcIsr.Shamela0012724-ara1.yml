90#VERS#COMMENT##: Good correspondence, no obvious errors. Biographical
    tags were added manually.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I changed the tag for a few cross-references to
    ### $$$ and also changed the levelling of two headers.  From page 480 onwards,
    there is just a list of names, and not biographies. However, I kept the ### $
    tag for the items since they are useful to identify the names.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
