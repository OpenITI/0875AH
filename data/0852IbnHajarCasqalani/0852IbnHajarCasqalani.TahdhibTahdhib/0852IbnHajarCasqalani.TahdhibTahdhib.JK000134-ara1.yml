    See, `README.md` for details.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): A lot of untagged headers tagged. Levelling of the headers corrected. The number of name tags checked and corrected through Peter’s script (a few duplicate numbers seem to be problems in the printed version.). 2- The edition of the digital version cannot be found online (deleted from websites for copyright issue), and the annotator just mentions using a different edition for collation without specifying which edition it was. Several editions of the text are accessible online: https://archive.org/details/ozkorallh_20181026_2110; https://archive.org/details/TEHBUTTEHB03IbnHaderElAsqaln; https://archive.org/details/tahzeeb-ut-tahzeeb; https://archive.org/details/091518.
