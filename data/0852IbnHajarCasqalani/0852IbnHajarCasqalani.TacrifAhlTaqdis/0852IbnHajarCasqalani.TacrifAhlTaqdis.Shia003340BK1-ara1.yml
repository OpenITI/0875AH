        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): As written on the cover page,
        There are three appendixes at the end of the book (page 60 onwards) added by
        the editor,
        collecting the names that are lacking in the original text,
        plus two sections on tadlīs by al-Dhahabī and his student Abu Mahmud al-
        Maqdisī
        (see introduction p. 7).
        The appendixes were split off as
        1450CasimQaryuti.MalahiqTacrifAhlTaqdis.Shia003340BK2-ara1
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
