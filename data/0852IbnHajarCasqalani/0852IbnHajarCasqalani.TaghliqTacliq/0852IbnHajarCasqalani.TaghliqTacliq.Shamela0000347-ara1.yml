90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari.  Good correspondence
        w/ printed edition.  The autotagging had tagged many subsections that
        refer to the chapters of the original work.  While these are not
        hierarchical markers per se, I have kept (and checked most of them)  as
        they are useful for navigation and cross-referencing w/ the original
        work.  It also seemed counterintuitive to remove them.  Occasionally,
        page dividers out by a couple of lines (e.g. v3: 184/5).
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): I agree with the annotator about keeping the second-
        level auto-tagged headers. I realized that there are more cases that have not
        been taken by the auto-tagging. So, I found and tagged more cases of this kind
        by RegEx. However, the text probably needs to be read closely by a specialist
        since there might still be more cases. 2- A few untagged first-level headers
        tagged, and subsequent levelling changed accordingly.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
