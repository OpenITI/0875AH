90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: SP Loynes
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari. The file
    was an 'in progress' fileÂ and, thankfully (!), the 27 volumes were
    mostly annotated. The work is divided into a series of comments on
    individual hadiths; each hadith is labelled by the basic ### $ label.
    The hadiths are numbered consecutively on the printed edition from vol.
    2 onwards (w/ the numbering beginning again in each 'book'). The
    numbering on the digital edition is not consistent. Similarly, each main
    chapter (kitab) and sub-chapter (bab) were also numbered in the digital
    edition but not consistently. Items were checked on a random basis to
    confirm alignment w/ the text. The text appears to closely conform to
    the printed edition despite erroneous numbering. Occasionally,
    subsections were tagged incorrectly. At the beginning of a number of
    sections the letter ha' has been disconnected from the verb hadathna;
    perhaps this can automatically be corrected w/ a Regex (there are
    variations in the parameters).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
