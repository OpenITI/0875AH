90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari. The file was an 'in progress' file and, thankfully (!), the 27 volumes were mostly annotated. The work is divided into a series of comments on individual hadiths; each hadith is labelled by the basic ### $ label. The hadiths are numbered consecutively on the printed edition from vol. 2 onwards (w/ the numbering beginning again in each 'book'). The numbering on the digital edition is not consistent. Similarly, each main chapter (kitab) and sub-chapter (bab) were also numbered in the digital edition but not consistently. Items were checked on a random basis to confirm alignment w/ the text. The text appears to closely conform to the printed edition despite erroneous numbering. Occasionally, subsections were tagged incorrectly. At the beginning of a number of sections the letter ha' has been disconnected from the verb hadathna; perhaps this can automatically be corrected w/ a Regex (there are variations in the parameters).
