90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a compound text, containing the text of
    three separate, incomplete, editions:
    * ed. al-Hajeri, Edinburgh 2007, which covers only the years 431-520
    (GVDB20230424)
    * ed. Amīn, Cairo 1987-1989, years 648-717 (ShamAY0033840)
    * ed. Qarmūṭ, Cairo 1985-1989, years 815-850 (MMS00021)
    PV joined both editions together
    (volume numbers of the Hajeri edition encoded as PageV11,
    volume numbers of the Amīn edition encoded as PageV21-PageV24,
    volume numbers of the Qarmūṭ edition encoded as PageV41-PageV42).
    PV added structural annotation
    (without cross-checking with the original editions).
    The text is still incomplete (other editions cover other parts
    of the work, but even then, the entire work is not edited yet)
